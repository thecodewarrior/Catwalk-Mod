Caged Ladders

Caged Ladders are ladders that support themselves and can't be fallen out of.

The sides of caged ladders can be toggled on or off by right clicking them with a Blowtorch.

Caged Ladders can be added above or below another by right clicking the small areas in center of the top and bottom of the ladder.
